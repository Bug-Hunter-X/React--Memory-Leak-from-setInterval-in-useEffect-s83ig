This repository demonstrates a common React bug involving memory leaks caused by improper use of the `setInterval` function within the `useEffect` hook.  The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.  The issue arises from failing to clear the interval using `clearInterval` in the cleanup function of `useEffect`, leading to a memory leak. The corrected solution demonstrates the proper way to handle intervals within `useEffect`, preventing memory leaks.
